This Ladies and Gents, needs no introduction, for you all know George W.
"Dubya" Bush. What you may not know is the Daily Show, which is a
popular news satire show in the US. If you have time I recommend you
have a look on YouTube for more videos...

Calendar](http://www.dueyfinster.eu/about/calendar), which is 10x more
nifty than that awful Iframe calendar I had before!
