now is it truly becoming clear, their is [serious money in Open
Source](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/applications/0,39020384,39256661,00.htm).
With [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.com/) reported to have made tens of
millions of dollars. One blogger reported 70m was made by the
corporation, with a Mozilla insider confirming thats a reasonable
ballpark figure. Christopher Blizzard, board member of Mozilla, had this
to say on his blog:

One obvious source of the money is [Google Inc.](http://www.google.ie/),
which Firefox gives prominance![Mozilla

default search engine, of the open source browser. Jason Calacanis, the
chief executive of blogging network Weblogs, wrote in his blog that an
unnamed source at BarCampLA told him:  
> Calacanis claimed that when a Firefox user does a Google search using
> the browser’s search box, Mozilla receives approximately 80 percent of
> the ad revenue from any associated ad clicks.

Pretty impressive for a company, which only earned 5m in 2004. The
continued success in![Firefox

the the 10-fold increase of Mozilla’s profits. Most People wish Mozilla
well, with some questioning the Corporations commitment to better
development, in favour of more lucrative contracts, this, of course, is
denied by everyone at Mozilla Corp. Only time will tell! In the
meantime, rumours are abound, Mozilla is to [distribute its
cash](http://uk.builder.com/manage/work/0,39026594,39304018,00.htm) to
big developers, and increase its workforce form 40 to 150.
