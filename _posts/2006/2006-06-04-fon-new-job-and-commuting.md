I regularly read other
Irish blogs to see whats happening and whats the latest tech thing[![FON

amongst others. It seems that may have come to fruition, with FON, a
community wifi project, sending me out a free router!! I am exicted
about this, as I hope to convince all my neighbours eventually to get
it, and maybe who knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if
I take my campaign estate wide, to neighbours all around! I want to “eat
my own dog food” as they say, so I will wait until I have recieved and
used my router before I recommend it to non-technical people. I have
read of long delays on FON’s forums, so I expect iot should be here
within two to three weeks, maybe a little longer. Also it comes with a
european plug, not a Irish/British one, which is a bit of a
disappointment that I will have to root out the screwdriver to make it
fit!!!  
Also, I was recently employed by the Irish National Lottery contractors,
GTECH Ireland Operations, part of GTECH Corporation (who trade as
**GTK** on New York Stock Exchange). It was voted one of the fifty best
places to work last year. I am very exicited at the prospect, as I will
gain many insights on the life of working. They own a number of
franchise lotterys around the world, including the United Kingdom,
Portugal and Spain.  
I also, as part of my new job, join the Dublin commute. Iarnrod Eireann,
while after[![Irish

coming on in recent years is a fine company, I still believe it has a
long way to go. The lack of a cheap, clean and friendly transport system
does hurt Dublin in terms of tourism and business, of that I have no
doubt. I was recently in Rome, which you get 75 minutes unlimited travel
on the bus, plus one metro journey, all for, get this, €1! Yes you read
that correctly €1! Why can’t we do this? I think we can, but we need an
integrated transport system first. How come after all these years you
still cannot get a ticket for Bus, Train and Luas in one? Thats what
baffles me the most, and it could make a huge difference, one ticket!
