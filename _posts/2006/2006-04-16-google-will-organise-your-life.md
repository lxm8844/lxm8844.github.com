Google have released a calendar, as part of their mission to “Organise
the Worlds Information”. While it is what you expect from Google, the
Calendar did not impress me a whole lot. It does have an intuitive
interface, that is easy to use. It does integrate with Gmail, although
the full extent has yet to be seen, as they fall short of mentioning it
in Gmail at all, but I would expect this to change. I see great
potential for users though, and where Google is heading. They will
eventually integrate it with GoogleTalk and Gmail, producing a hybrid
interface where you can organise a conference on GoogleTalk, schedule it
on your calendar (which is syncronised with your PC and your workgroup
server [therby informing fellow employees]), submit video of it to
Google Video, write minutes with writely, email minutes with Gmail, that
mail (with document and video) being attached to the meeting on the
Calendar, which is in turn archived on your PC in Google Desktop and
your Gmail Drive. While that is only one scenario, it is very possible.
Google have already leaked information on their eagerness to hold the
entire contents of ones hard drive on the internet.

This of course leads to privacy fears, will the U.S. or Chinese
governments have access to literally anything on your computer? The
[Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/) is an online
rights advocacy group, and they recently discouraged people from
downloading the latest Google Desktop, due to the fact it will backup
your information online for 30 days. You can exclude folders and files
from Google Desktops index, but this is a manual process. So where will
the future lie, and how far will Google go to get the most relevent
results? Who knows, but one thing is for sure, with their increase in
market share at expense of MSN and Yahoo, Google is here to stay.
