So you have heard of Ubuntu, maybe they have even shipped you a free
disc or you have![Ubuntu Logo](http://www.vmware.com/img/ubuntu.gif)
downloaded one? Like most users, even advanced PC users, they get
nervous about installing Linux and afraid of what they might have to
learn. Touted as the brighest star, Ubuntu really does outshine other
Linuxes, with usability, features and great range of software. Now you
can try Ubuntu on Windows.

How can I try it, is what I always get asked, without risk to my
computer? First of all, you need to download [Ubuntu
Virtual](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/vmware/Ubuntu-5.10.zip). This in
laymans terms, is Ubuntu compressed into one file. Think of that file as
the “Tape”, now you need the “Tape Player”, along comes [VMWare
Player](http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmplayer/VMware-player-1.0.1-19317.exe "http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmplayer/VMware-player-1.0.1-19317.exe").
Simply install VMware Player, and then find the “Ubuntu Tape” file, in
VMware Player. Thats it! No installation required of Ubuntu. ![VMware

Similarly, you can use VMware player to emulate Windows on Ubuntu. Also
you can try the LiveCD of Ubuntu, which you insert at time you turn on
your computer and it loads Ubuntu, without affecting your PC or any
files on it. Both install and live disc of Ubuntu can be [ordered free
of charge.](http://shipit.ubuntu.com/ "http://shipit.ubuntu.com") ****
