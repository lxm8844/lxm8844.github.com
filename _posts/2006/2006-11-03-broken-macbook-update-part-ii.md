Looks like
[Mactivate](http://www.mactivate.ie/) got it wrong, [![Macbook
Black](http://static.flickr.com/111/252792233_4d87e73e02_m.jpg "Macbook Black")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/moria/252792233/ "Macbook Black")it
wasn't the heatsink, [as referred to by my earlier
post](http://www.dueyfinster.eu/2006/11/01/macbook-issue-identified/).
Looks like I have seen good advice from the Web, never buy a first
generation [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) product, until they work out
the kinks! I guess Mactivate have been snowed under with heatsink
problems, that they never bothered to check other parts of my Macbook,
since it is such a common
problem.[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/moria/252792233/)They have
ordered me a new "logic board" (I am guessing the
[PMU](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319) like I
thought it was ;-) ). In other news [Apple released a firmware
update](http://www.macfixit.com/article.php/2006110107475681#) for those
poor unfortunates that have been suffering [Random Shutdown
Syndrome](http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/) (or
[RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)) for short :-D ).
Hopefully I should have it back by this Tuesday (November 7th) plus a
new heatsink and logic board.... fingers crossed anyway!
