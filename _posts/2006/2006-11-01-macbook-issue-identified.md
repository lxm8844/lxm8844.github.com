Turns out my prediction
wasn't quite correct, it was not the Power Management Unit
([PMU](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319)), it was
the [heatsink](http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/).![MacBook

[Mactivate](http://www.mactivate.ie/) have informed me they have one on
order from [Apple](http://www.apple.ie/), so it will take a bit longer
than I anticipated to get my
[Macbook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html) back. I found this
strange as I had not experienced random shutdowns like the ones that
have been widely reported across the web. it was like I described in my
earlier post, something to do with the battery not being able to charge.
Then again, I am no expert on this and their is wide evidence (over 1600
people have identified heatsink as a problem in their Macbooks) that the
heatsink is a definite issue. Sounds like good or bad I will have a lot
more to say about Apple Computer in the future, thats why I have decided
to add them as a category.
