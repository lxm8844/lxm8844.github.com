I have a
[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wikipedia Article on Wiki") at
[wiki.dueyfinster.eu](http://wiki.dueyfinster.eu/ "Duey Finsters Wiki")
for messing about! I haven't found a purpose for it![Duey Finsters
Logo](http://wiki.dueyfinster.eu/skins/tango/tango-logo.gif "Duey Finsters Logo")
yet, but I'd like to have it all set up incase one day I turn out to
need it (maybe for collaboration or something?). If you have any skill
at themin' [MediaWiki](htpp://www.mediawiki.org "MediaWiki") (the most
popular wiki software, run but
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), no less) please,
[please get in
touch!](http://www.dueyfinster.eu/about/contact/ "Neil Grogan Contact")
I would do it all myself, but my time is constrained at the moment, but
I will eventually do it myself I suppose ;-)  
  
Some of you may have noticed downtime lately, that's because of the
wordpress.com domains add-on is a shambles, at least for dot-eu anyhoo.
Support tried to be helpful, and to be fair it was a new feature, but I
wasted $10 (about â‚¬7.50) for nothing, as I couldn't use dueyfinster.eu
with it. Half of it was perhaps my fault, as I couldn't use MX records
(for redirecting mail requests) to my
[GFYD](https://www.google.com/a/ "Google for your Domain") so I tried to
add more nameservers, having the first pointing at Wordpress.com and the
rest pointing at Google. Needless to say after to-ing and fro-ing I
decided to keep my self hosted solution, as it offers total control
(such as my own template, javascript, etc.). That is why the site was
down, it kept resolving at different locations :-(  
I got the Macbook back from
[Mactivate](http://www.mactivate.ie "Mactivate"), complete with a new
logic board (aka. the PMU I often and painfully referred to in my
earlier posts). I had a bit of a scare though, as less than two hours
after I got it back, the Macbook would only show the LED light when I
tryed to power it on. I was worried I'd face at least another two weeks
away from my laptop! I saw another Apple knowledge base article,
describing it could be the RAM unseated. I popped off the battery, only
to see the smallest phillips head screws you could imagine. It took me
well over a day to find a jewellers screwdriver (luckily a relative of
mine had one :-) ). I guess Apple do this, so it is awkward to buy RAM
from others. To my hope of all hopes, I popped the RAM out and in, and
hey presto it works! I have not had a problem since (fingers crossed).
Writing this post from it now by the way.......
