Hello, I'm Neil Grogan and I work for [Ericsson][] as a Software Engineer 
for Network Management. Before that I was student of Computer Science 
in [Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown][] where I earned a first class 
Bachelor of Science Honours degree in Computer Science.

The views contained within this blog are strictly my own and never the 
view of former, current or future employers.

Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy.
